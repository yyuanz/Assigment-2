				<p>Hi,everyone. I'm Yuanyuan Zhao, visual designer,and this is my story.
				   I was born in China in 1993, I've been learning drawing since I was a little girl, I had a dream of becoming a painter that time, in order to finish my madatory nine-years' education, I stopped paniting and drowned myself in the education system. But in order to continue persuing art, I chose adverting as my major in college. After spending four years in the east of China, I continued my study and explored a new territory of art, which is design. So I want to continue my career in design area, and at the same time, I wanted to see the world and broaden my horizen so I could become a better designer, so I appied for some MFA degrees in United States, and I got an offer from Boston University, then I started my life as a graduate student that majored in graphic design in Boston University.
				   To be continued......</p>
